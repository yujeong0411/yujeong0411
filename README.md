Healthcare & Data Product Planner  
with hands-on development experience

## Summary

Problem-driven product planner with a healthcare background.

I started my career as a nurse and spent 5 years in clinical environments,
where I learned how real-world systems often fail users.
To better design solutions that are both well-planned and realistically implementable,
I began learning software, data, and AI development.

I focus on defining problems clearly,
structuring service logic, and exploring practical MVP options under constraints.

## What I Focus On

- 🧠 Problem definition grounded in real domain pain points  
- 🧩 Structuring services & deciding MVP scope  
- 🤖 Applying AI/LLMs as tools, not as headline features  
- 📊 Data-informed decision making  
- 🏥 Healthcare & public-safety domain understanding
